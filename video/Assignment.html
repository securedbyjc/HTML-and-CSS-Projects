		<h1>Different Dimensional Beings?</h1>
		<p></p>
		<h3>When I was 15 years old...</h3>I met a man on the subway train while on my way into the city to visit some friends. I got onto the last car of the train and an older gentleman was the only other person on the train. Something about his vibe drew me in and I sat across from him. He started up a conversion about what school I went to and my family dynamics. I figured he must have understood the struggles what most teenagers go through at home with their parents at this development period. Especially one that was totally consumed with finding his life path, in order leave his parent's house as soon as graduation from high school was acheived. <p>When he asked about my favorite subject in school and I said, "History at the moment!" His face light up with joy and the mutual interests peaked our consersation. Just as the conversation was really getting good he asked, "What station are you getting off at?" My stop was coming within the next 2 stations. He said excitedly, "great, I have something I want to show you something once we get above ground." I agreed and once we exited train and we headed up the escaltor. Once up top, he said very seriously to always remember what he was about to show me. Is was clear eveing sky and all the constellations were shining brightly. As well was the was moon. </p><p>The gentlemean pointed to the moon and told me to watch his finger as it traced in a southernly direction below the moon and then sharply to the right. He pointed at a very bright star and he called out the different colors the star changed to as a way for me to identify the exact star he was referencing. He said these words, "That star is our there is our home and you will return there some day." When I turned around to look him his eyes to make sure he wasn't nut case, he was gone!!! Did I just I spend the last 30 minutes on the train with a man that never exisited or did I come face to face with a different dimensional being?</p>
